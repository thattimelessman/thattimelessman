I'm **Agraj**, a Computer Science student based in India.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack interests lie in **react**, **typescript**, and **tailwind**.

My favorite tools are **Notion**, **Claude**, and **GitHub**.

I'm currently focusing on learning **Java** & **Python**.

I’ve been practicing problems on **Leetcode** and **Hackerrank**, and I often post the solutions here.

If you want to connect, **my social links are available here!**

#### Fun Facts:

- I love to sketch and write  
- I don’t like coffee or tea
